# Oxford Term Dates

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ox-it/oxford-term-dates.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ox-it/oxford-term-dates)

This provides a nice Python library for converting calendar dates into Oxford
term dates, and vice versa. Have a look in oxford_term_dates/__init__.py for
more fun things.

As an added bonus, this is also a fully functional Django app, which will
provide a tag and a filter:

 * {{ oxford_date_today }} - prints the current date in Oxford form
 * {{ date|oxdate }} - filters a date to be shown in Oxford form
